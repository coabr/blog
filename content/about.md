# About

Hi, I'm Carolina, but please call me Carol :)
I'm originally graduated in Business Management and Civil Engineer. I'm from Brazil but living in Canada since 2021.
Got to know about programming around 2018 when I was living in Russia, started studing more about in 2019 and in 2020 I got my first job as a Software Developer. Since then I've been learning a lot, as I had at that time a total of zero background about it. 
Nowadays I work at an awesome company based in Brazil called [Capyba](https://capyba.com/).
